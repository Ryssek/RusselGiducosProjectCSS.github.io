          <p>
            The Computer Systems Servicing (CSS) strand is a specialized
            vocational course that focuses on the technical aspects of computer
            systems and their maintenance. This strand is designed to equip
            students with the knowledge and skills needed to diagnose, repair,
            and maintain computer hardware and software. Through a combination
            of theoretical lessons and hands-on practical training, students
            gain a deep understanding of computer systems and learn how to
            troubleshoot various issues that may arise.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the key areas of focus in the CSS strand is computer
            hardware. Students learn about the different components of a
            computer system, such as the motherboard, CPU, memory, and storage
            devices. They also learn how to assemble and disassemble computer
            systems, install and configure hardware components, and diagnose and
            resolve hardware-related problems. This knowledge is crucial in the
            field of computer servicing, as hardware failures are common and
            require technical expertise to fix.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to hardware, the CSS strand also covers software-related
            topics. Students learn about operating systems, software
            installation, and configuration. They gain hands-on experience in
            installing and configuring different operating systems, such as
            Windows and Linux, and learn how to troubleshoot software-related
            issues. This knowledge is essential for ensuring the smooth
            operation of computer systems and optimizing their performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important aspect of the CSS strand is network
            troubleshooting and maintenance. Students learn about computer
            networks, including concepts such as IP addressing, subnetting, and
            network protocols. They acquire skills in setting up and configuring
            network devices, diagnosing network connectivity issues, and
            implementing security measures. With the increasing reliance on
            networked systems in today's world, these skills are highly valuable
            and in demand.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CSS strand also emphasizes the importance of professionalism and
            customer service in the field of computer servicing. Students learn
            about effective communication skills, problem-solving techniques,
            and ethical practices. They understand the importance of providing
            timely and efficient service to customers, and how to manage
            customer expectations and handle challenging situations
            professionally. These soft skills are essential for building a
            successful career in computer systems servicing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Throughout the course, students in the CSS strand engage in
            practical exercises and projects to apply their knowledge and
            skills. They work on real-world scenarios, troubleshooting common
            computer issues, and maintaining computer systems in a simulated
            environment. This hands-on approach allows them to develop their
            problem-solving abilities and gain the confidence needed to tackle
            complex computer servicing tasks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon completion of the CSS strand, students have various career
            options available to them. They can work as computer technicians,
            providing technical support and maintenance services to individuals
            and organizations. They can also pursue further education in the
            field of computer science or information technology, specializing in
            areas such as system administration, network engineering, or
            cybersecurity. The skills and knowledge acquired in the CSS strand
            provide a solid foundation for further career growth and
            development.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, the Computer Systems Servicing (CSS) strand is a
            vocational course that equips students with the technical skills and
            knowledge needed to diagnose, repair, and maintain computer systems.
            From hardware troubleshooting to software installation and network
            maintenance, students gain a comprehensive understanding of computer
            servicing. Additionally, they develop important soft skills, such as
            communication and problem-solving abilities, as well as
            professionalism and customer service. With a hands-on approach and
            practical exercises, students are prepared for various career
            opportunities in the field of computer systems servicing or further
            education in related disciplines
